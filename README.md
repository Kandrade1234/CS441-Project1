A short hello world program with button functionality. I Added two button functionalities.

The first one is a floating action button. The floating action button resembles the mail icon and when clicked it takes you directly to the gmail site. The second button generates a series of text...intended for the user to laugh. You can click as many times, the text will loop over and over.
